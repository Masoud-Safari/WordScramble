# WordScramble: A Vocabulary-Building Game

## Introduction

WordScramble is an engaging app developed during my journey through the Hacking with Swift course. The app presents users with a random 8-letter word, challenging them to create as many words as possible with the given letters. This project was an excellent opportunity to explore more advanced SwiftUI concepts and improve my understanding of list views, user input, and string manipulation.

## Project Description

### What the App Does

- **Functionality:** The app generates a random word and asks users to make new words using the letters from the generated word. It includes checks to ensure that only valid, non-repeated words are entered. The app keeps score based on the number of correct words and their length.
- **Technologies Used:** Built with SwiftUI, the app leverages list views for displaying user entries, alerts for feedback, and extensive use of Swift's string manipulation capabilities to validate word entries.
- **App Demo:**

### Purpose and Learning

- **Objective:** My goal was to deepen my understanding of SwiftUI, particularly how to handle dynamic lists, process user input, and integrate basic algorithms for string manipulation and validation.
- **Challenges and Solutions:** Ensuring that user input was correctly validated using an older spell check API was a challenge. I implemented a series of checks for word existence, length, and uniqueness that enhanced my problem-solving skills.
- **Skills Gained:** This project strengthened my skills in SwiftUI, especially in creating interactive UIs and managing state. It also improved my ability to work with Swift's standard library for string processing and validation techniques.
